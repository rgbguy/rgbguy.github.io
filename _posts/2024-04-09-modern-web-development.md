# Modern Web Development: Trends and Tools

The web development landscape is constantly evolving. Here's a look at some current trends and essential tools for modern web development.

## JavaScript Frameworks

Modern web development often revolves around powerful JavaScript frameworks:

- **React**: A popular library for building user interfaces
- **Vue.js**: A progressive framework for building user interfaces
- **Svelte**: A radical new approach to building user interfaces

## Essential Development Tools

1. **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for code management
2. **Package Managers**: npm and yarn for dependency management
3. **Build Tools**: Webpack, Vite, and esbuild for bundling
4. **Testing**: Jest, Cypress, and Playwright for testing

## Modern CSS Features

CSS has evolved significantly with features like:

```css
/* CSS Grid */
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 1rem;
}

/* CSS Custom Properties */
:root {
  --primary-color: #007bff;

}

/* Flexbox */
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
```
