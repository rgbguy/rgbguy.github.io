# Welcome to My Blog

This is a sample blog post to demonstrate how simple it is to write content in Markdown.

## Writing Code

You can include code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## Lists and Formatting

- Bullet points are easy
- Just use markdown syntax
- And it works automatically

1. Numbered lists too
2. Just as simple
3. No HTML required

**Bold text** and *italic text* are supported, along with [links](https://example.com).

## Images

You can include images:

That's it! Just write your content in Markdown and the theme will handle the styling automatically.
