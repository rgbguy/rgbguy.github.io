Been thinking a lot about having a purely technical blog where I post about my experiements, the stuff that I read, the things that I create. So, here we go!

The past 2 years have been one hell of a learning journey. I have explored so many things that were beyond my usual expertise. Right from diving into UNIX to Vulkan to actually buying a hardware kit to experiment. The time spent in doing this has been absolutely rewarding. I feel like "The more I know, the more I know that I know less" and there's a long path ahead, which I am pretty excited about.
